# UniversalMusicLibrary
A music streaming library that supports links from different platforms

The objective of this app is to allow the users to put links (YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music, etc) and listen to music without needing to change the app.

This would allow the users to have a single application from which they could controll what music they are listening to.

Do you want to listen to a song from YouTube, followed by a playlist on Spotify, another music from YouTube and, finally, a playlist from Apple Music?

With this app, you could do all of this without entering and leaving three different applications.

Spotify API isn't very stable. There is a known issue that is still persistent on some devices.
Initial reported problem in 0.6.3: https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/issues/139
Problem still here in 0.7.0 : https://github.com/spotify/android-sdk/issues/180

Apple Music API is not implemented, but it can be added without much problems.
